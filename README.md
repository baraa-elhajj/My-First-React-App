# My First React App using Vite + TypeScript

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

## Setup

1. Run `npm create vite@latest app-name -- --template react-ts` to create a React app using Vite.

2. Follow the UI and select React then TypeScript.

3. Navigate to the created directory and run `npm install` to install project dependencies.

4. Now run `npm run dev` to run the project.

## Notes

- React Hooks: React Hooks are special functions in React that allow us to use features like state and side effects in functional components â€” which we couldn't do before without writing a class.

- Union types can take several data types. Types are separated by a pipe "|".

- useState(): lets you remember things. When data changes, it re-renders the UI.
